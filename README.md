# Standalone ANNIE Analysis

This repository contains various subdirectories consisting of standalone analysis tools and scripts created and implemented outside the primary analysis framework for ANNIE, ToolAnalysis. Eventually, some of these analyses will be converted into Tools within ToolAnalysis.

## Subdirectories

1. **pyANNIEEventDisplay**
     - Python Event Display for visualizing events within the ANNIE detector. Currently implemented for MC low-energy events (no MRD/FMV).
